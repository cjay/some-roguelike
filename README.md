# some-roguelike

The beginnings of a roguelike using https://github.com/cjay/vulkyrie

Current state: Shows a 2d tilemap with an autogenerated level, character and enemies.
You can walk around and the enemies will run towards you, that's all.
Arrows keys change the direction indicator, space makes a step.

This serves mostly just a tech demo and testbed for Vulkyrie right now.
It currently uses Vulkyrie more like helper lib for Vulkan than like 
a proper graphics engine, needing only about 400 lines for the graphics 
part (Graphics.hs), without Vulkyrie it would need a few thousand lines.

If you want to try, as of right now you should use GHC 8.8, as I'm waiting 
for multiple dependencies to accept my pull requests for 8.10.
